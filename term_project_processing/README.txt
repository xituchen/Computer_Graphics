Because of conflicts between Processing.js and Processing in Java, we were not able to export our application as JavaScript and host it, but it is viable to create a Java Applet and put it online. 

Interesting screenshots of the progress is included in the data folder (the beginning is full of bugs and funsies). We could even host a website for interesting screenshots.
